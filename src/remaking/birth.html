<span style="color:#00ffff">Creating a Character</span>

<p>FrogComposband is a role-playing game in which you - the player - control a character in a dangerous world of myth and magic, populated with demons, dragons, deities, ducks and other rare and strange creatures of the Last Days. The most important decision you make on your quest to slay the <span style="color:#ff0000">Serpent of Chaos</span> is what kind of character to play: spell-wielding magician or sword-waving warrior? Stealthy rogue or musical bard? Holy priest or evil spawn of chaos? The choices are myriad, and the process of generating a new character is described in this help file, which will also serve to introduce you to many of the core concepts of the game.</p>

<p>Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of choices. You must choose your character's race ( <span style="color:#ff0000">Human</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Dwarf</span>,  <span style="color:#ff0000">Hobbit</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Ogre</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Vampire</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Werewolf</span>, etc), your character's class ( <span style="color:#ff0000">Warrior</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Mage</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Priest</span>,  <span style="color:#ff0000">Lawyer</span>, etc) and your character's personality ( <span style="color:#ff0000">Mighty</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Shrewd </span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Chaotic</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Split</span>, etc). Each of these choices is described in the help files (see <a href="raceclass_contents.html"><span style="color:#00ff00">[a]</span></a>).</p>

<p>There are three main screens for the birth process. The first is a brief welcome screen in which you select the type of game to play (the <span style="color:#ff0000">Game Mode</span> ). The next screen allows you to select or change your race, class, gender, personality and character's name. The final screen allows you to enter your starting stats. We will describe each of these screens in detail, explaining things as we go. Ready?</p>

<a id="Welcome"></a>
<span style="color:#c00000">The Welcome Screen</span>
<p>The first screen is the Welcome Screen. It simply introduces you to the game and allows you to choose one of several options that will control the birth process. It looks something like this:</p>

<p>Welcome to <span style="color:#ff0000">FrogComposband</span>, a dungeon exploration role-playing game. Your goal is to defeat the dreaded <span style="color:#ff0000">Serpent of Chaos</span>, but before you can face it, you must battle many foes. Your first step is to create a character for this quest. The following screens will guide you through this process so that you may quickly begin playing. You can get general help at any time by pressing <span style="color:#ff8000">[?]</span>.</p>

<p>First, you must decide what type of game to play. <span style="color:#ff0000">Beginner Mode</span> limits the options available, simplifying things for new players.</p>

<div class="container">

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col"><span style="color:#ffff00"> ESC </span> ) Quit</div>
    </div>
</div>


<p><span style="color:#00ff00">Tip:</span> You can often get specific help by entering the uppercase letter for a command. For example, type <span style="color:#ff8000">[B]</span> on this screen to receive help on Beginner Mode.</p>


<p>If you are new to the game, consider the <span style="color:#ff0000">Beginner</span> mode. With this option, you won't be so overwhelmed with choices as is normally the case, allowing you to breeze through the birth process and quickly begin playing (and enjoying) this game. Once you have played a few times and wish to experience more of what the game has to offer, including a vast wilderness with many diverse dungeons to explore and the full array of race, class and personality choices, then you should choose the <span style="color:#ff0000">Normal</span> mode.</p>

<p>If you are truly bold you can experiment with the <span style="color:#ff0000">Monster</span> option, which allows you to play as one of many different types of monster. Monsters don't have a class, but instead evolve into more powerful forms as they gain experience. They also tend to have variable body types, making the equipment sub-game both more fun and more challenging.</p>

<p>Also on this screen may be an option to <span style="color:#ff0000">Quick Start</span>. This option simply repeats the birth selections of your previous character, who presumably just met an untimely demise. This is a useful option if you are dying often in the early game, as it greatly speeds up the birth process.</p>

<a id="RaceClass"></a>
<span style="color:#c00000">The Race/Class Screen</span>

<p>On this screen, you can change your race, your class and (unless you picked Beginner Mode) your personality. The screen will look something like the following:</p>

<p><span style="color:#00ff00">Tip:</span> You can often get specific help by entering the uppercase letter for a command. For example, type <span style="color:#ff8000">[B]</span> on this screen to receive help on your currently selected race.</p>

<p>So, what do we see? First, the fields in <span style="color:#00ffff">blue</span> are those that you may change on this screen. Default selections are already in (and sane enough to play with), but you probably want to change them and make your own picks. Your sex is essentially just flavor, and has almost no game-play effects (choices are limited to simply Male and Female, but at least the game is progressive enough to provide ways to swap between those during play!). The other selections you can make are much more important, though: your <span style="color:#ff0000">race</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">class</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">personality</span>, and <span style="color:#ff0000">magic realms</span> (if any) will form the key to your character.</p>

<p>To the right is a table displaying information about the stat bonuses and other modifiers you would receive from your current race, class and personality choices. Every character has six basic attributes, called <span style="color:#ff0000">stats</span>, that are very important to game play; finding ways to increase your stats will be one of your main practical goals during the game. The six basic stats are: Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON) and Charisma (CHR); see <a href="birth.html#PrimaryStats"><span style="color:#00ff00">[b]</span></a> below for more detailed information. Your character's spell stat, if any, is displayed in <span style="color:#ff00ff">violet</span>; this is a very important stat for magical classes, since it determines how well the character can cast spells, and normally you want it to be as high as possible.</p>

<p>On the next screen, you will choose the starting stats for this character, and the values you choose will be modified by the amount shown in the table. The bottom row in the table is the total row, showing you a nice summary of the cumulative effects of your various birth choices. It is the value in this row that gets added to your starting stats.</p>

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">Other fields in the table include:</div>
        <div class="col"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="margin-left: 50px">
        <div class="col-1"><span style="color:#ff0000">Life</span>:</div>
        <div class="col">Life Multiplier. This value multiplies your maximum hit points (HP). Hit points are your character's health; if your hit points go below zero, you die and the game is over! See <a href="faq.html#LifeRating"><span style="color:#00ff00">[c]</span></a> for more on how your maximum hit points are calculated.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="margin-left: 50px">
        <div class="col-1"><span style="color:#ff0000">BHP</span>:</div>
        <div class="col">Short for Base Hit Points, this value is a lump sum added to your starting hit points to make the early game easier.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" style="margin-left: 50px">
        <div class="col-1"><span style="color:#ff0000">Exp</span>:</div>
        <div class="col">Short for Experience Factor, this percentage determines how quickly or slowly your character gains new levels. (All players begin at level 1, and may advance up to level 50. Increasing your level gives more hit points, improves your skills, gives access to more powerful spells, and may also provide other effects or bonuses.)</div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>In addition to stats, your player also has skills (see <a href="birth.html#PrimarySkills"><span style="color:#00ff00">[d]</span></a> below). For example, your Melee skill determines your ability to hit monsters in hand to hand combat. Like stats, these skills are also affected by your birth options, and are displayed in the information table on this and the next screen; but, since your screen is only so wide, you'll need to use the <span style="color:#ff8000">[TAB]</span> key:</p>

<p>Ah, we see that hobbits aren't so good at melee. However, the class choice of Rogue more than makes up for this, and we can tell from the summary line that this character's melee skill will be pretty good. It is a general rule that class influences skills more than race and personality do, especially later in the game (as you gain levels, you also gain skill bonuses, but mostly through your class). The main
    exception to this rule is Stealth, where the bonuses tend to be zero.</p>

<p>Below the player fields and the information table is a list of commands that you may choose. These commands might bring up a menu of choices for you to select from, as, for example, the Change Race command:</p>

<p style="width: 800px; padding: 22px 100px;"><span style="color:#00ff00">Note: Although pressing</span> <span style="color:#ff8000">[?]</span> <span style="color:#00ff00">on the introduction screen will take you here, and this page does give a quick overview of much in the game, it is not the main page for the entire help system.

<a id="CreateAt"></a>

<span style="color:#00ffff">Creating a Character</span>

<p>FrogComposband is a role-playing game in which you - the player - control a character in a dangerous world of myth and magic, populated with demons, dragons, deities, ducks and other rare and strange creatures of the Last Days. The most important decision you make on your quest to slay the <span style="color:#ff0000">Serpent of Chaos</span> is what kind of character to play: spell-wielding magician or sword-waving warrior? Stealthy rogue or musical bard? Holy priest or evil spawn of chaos? The choices are myriad, and the process of generating a new character is described in this help file, which will also serve to introduce you to many of the core concepts of the game.</p>

<p>Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of choices. You must choose your character's race (<span style="color:#ff0000">Human</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Dwarf</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Hobbit</span>,<span style="color:#ff0000">Ogre</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Vampire</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Werewolf</span>, etc), your character's class (<span style="color:#ff0000">Warrior</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Mage</span>,<span style="color:#ff0000">Priest</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Lawyer</span>, etc) and your character's personality (<<span style="color:#ff0000">Mighty</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Shrewd</span>,<span style="color:#ff0000">Chaotic</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Split</span>, etc). Each of these choices is described in the help files (see <a href="raceclass_contents.html"><span style="color:#00ff00">[a]</span></a>).</p>

<p>There are three main screens for the birth process. The first is a brief welcome screen in which you select the type of game to play (the <span style="color:#ff0000">Game Mode</span>). The next screen allows you to select or change your race, class, gender, personality and character's name. The final screen allows you to enter your starting stats. We will describe each of these screens in detail, explaining things as we go. Ready?</p>

<a id="Welcome"></a>
<span style="color:#c00000">The Welcome Screen</span>

<p>The first screen is the Welcome Screen. It simply introduces you to the game and allows you to choose one of several options that will control the birth process. It looks something like this:</p>

<p>Welcome to <span style="color:#ff0000">FrogComposband</span>, a dungeon exploration role-playing game. Your goal is to defeat the dreaded <span style="color:#ff0000">Serpent of Chaos</span>, but before you can face it, you must battle many foes. Your first step is to create a character for this quest. The following screens will guide you through this process so that you may quickly begin playing. You can get general help at any time by pressing <span style="color:#ff8000">[?]</span>.</p>

<p>First, you must decide what type of game to play. <span style="color:#ff0000">Beginner Mode</span> limits the options available, simplifying things for new <players class=""></players></p>

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col"><span style="color:#00ff00"> Choose the Type of Game to Play </span></div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col"><span style="color:#ffff00"> ESC </span> ) Quit</div>
    </div>
</div>

<br>

<p><span style="color:#00ff00">Tip: </span> You can often get specific help by entering the uppercase letter for a command. For example, type <span style="color:#ff8000">[B]</span> on this screen to receive help on Beginner Mode.</p>

<p>If you are new to the game, consider the <span style="color:#ff0000">Beginner</span> mode. With this option, you won't be so overwhelmed with choices as is normally the case, allowing you to breeze through the birth process and quickly begin playing (and enjoying) this game. Once you have played a few times and wish to experience more of what the game has to offer, including a vast wilderness with many diverse dungeons to explore and the full array of race, class and personality choices, then you should choose the <span style="color:#ff0000">Normal</span> mode.</p>

<p>If you are truly bold you can experiment with the <span style="color:#ff0000">Monster</span> option, which allows you to play as one of many different types of monster. Monsters don't have a class, but instead evolve into more powerful forms as they gain experience. They also tend to have variable body types, making the equipment sub-game both more fun and more challenging.</p>

<p>Also on this screen may be an option to <span style="color:#ff0000">Quick Start</span>. This option simply repeats the birth selections of your previous character, who presumably just met an untimely demise. This is a useful option if you are dying often in the early game, as it greatly speeds up the birth process.</p>

<a id="RaceClass"></a>
<span style="color:#c00000">The Race/Class Screen</span>

<p>On this screen, you can change your race, your class and (unless you picked Beginner Mode) your personality. The screen will look something like the following:</p>

<p><span style="color:#00ff00">Tip:</span> You can often get specific help by entering the uppercase letter for a command. For example, type <span style="color:#ff8000">[B]</span> on this screen to receive help on your currently selected race.</p>


<p>So, what do we see? First, the fields in </span><font color="#00ffff">blue </span><font color="#ffffff">are those that you may change on this screen. Default selections are already in (and sane enough to play with), but you probably want to change them and make your own picks. Your sex is essentially just flavor, and has almost no game-play effects (choices are limited to simply Male and Female, but at least the game is progressive enough to provide ways to swap between those during play!). The other selections you can make are much more important, though: your </span><font color="#ff0000">race</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">class</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">personality</span><font color="#ffffff">, and </span><font color="#ff0000">magic realms </span><font color="#ffffff">(if any) will form the key to your character.</p>

    To the right is a table displaying information about the stat bonuses
    and other modifiers you would receive from your current race, class and
    personality choices. Every character has six basic attributes, called
</span><font color="#ff0000">stats</span><font color="#ffffff">, that are very important to game play; finding ways to increase
    your stats will be one of your main practical goals during the game.
    The six basic stats are: Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom
    (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON) and Charisma (CHR); see <a href="birth.html#PrimaryStats"></span><font
        color="#00ff00">[b]</a>
</span><font color="#ffffff">below for more detailed information. Your character's spell stat, if
    any, is displayed in </span><font color="#ff00ff">violet</span><font color="#ffffff">; this is a very important stat for magical
    classes, since it determines how well the character can cast spells,
    and normally you want it to be as high as possible.

    On the next screen, you will choose the starting stats for this
    character, and the values you choose will be modified by the amount
    shown in the table. The bottom row in the table is the total row,
    showing you a nice summary of the cumulative effects of your various
    birth choices. It is the value in this row that gets added to your
    starting stats.

    Other fields in the table include:
</span><font color="#ff0000">Life</span><font color="#ffffff">: Life Multiplier. This value multiplies your maximum hit points
    (HP). Hit points are your character's health; if your hit
    points go below zero, you die and the game is over! See <a href="faq.html#LifeRating"></span><font
        color="#00ff00">[c]</a> </span><font color="#ffffff">for
    more on how your maximum hit points are calculated.
</span><font color="#ff0000">BHP</span><font color="#ffffff">:  Short for Base Hit Points, this value is a lump sum added to
    your starting hit points to make the early game easier.
</span><font color="#ff0000">Exp</span><font color="#ffffff">:  Short for Experience Factor, this percentage determines how
    quickly or slowly your character gains new levels. (All players
    begin at level 1, and may advance up to level 50. Increasing
    your level gives more hit points, improves your skills, gives
    access to more powerful spells, and may also provide other
    effects or bonuses.)

    In addition to stats, your player also has skills (see <a href="birth.html#PrimarySkills"></span><font color="#00ff00">[d]</a> </span><font
        color="#ffffff">below). For
    example, your Melee skill determines your ability to hit monsters in
    hand to hand combat. Like stats, these skills are also affected by your
    birth options, and are displayed in the information table on this and
    the next screen; but, since your screen is only so wide, you'll need to
    use the </span><font color="#ff8000">TAB </span><font color="#ffffff">key:

</span><font color="#ffffff">Ah, we see that hobbits aren't so good at melee. However, the class
    choice of Rogue more than makes up for this, and we can tell from the
    summary line that this character's melee skill will be pretty good. It
    is a general rule that class influences skills more than race and
    personality do, especially later in the game (as you gain levels, you
    also gain skill bonuses, but mostly through your class). The main
    exception to this rule is Stealth, where the bonuses tend to be zero.

    Below the player fields and the information table is a list of commands
    that you may choose. These commands might bring up a menu of choices
    for you to select from, as, for example, the Change Race command:

<a name="CreateAt"></a></span><font color="#00ffff">Creating a Character

</span><font color="#ffffff">FrogComposband is a role-playing game in which you - the player -
control a character in a dangerous world of myth and magic, populated
with demons, dragons, deities, ducks and other rare and strange
creatures of the Last Days. The most important decision you make on
your quest to slay the </span><font color="#ff0000">Serpent of Chaos </span><font color="#ffffff">is what kind of character to
play: spell-wielding magician or sword-waving warrior? Stealthy rogue
or musical bard? Holy priest or evil spawn of chaos? The choices are
myriad, and the process of generating a new character is described in
this help file, which will also serve to introduce you to many of the
core concepts of the game.

Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of
choices. You must choose your character's race (</span><font color="#ff0000">Human</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font
        color="#ff0000">Dwarf</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Hobbit</span><font
        color="#ffffff">,
</span><font color="#ff0000">Ogre</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Vampire</span><font
        color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Werewolf</span><font color="#ffffff">, etc), your character's class (</span><font
        color="#ff0000">Warrior</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Mage</span><font
        color="#ffffff">,
</span><font color="#ff0000">Priest</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Lawyer</span><font
        color="#ffffff">, etc) and your character's personality (</span><font color="#ff0000">Mighty</span><font
        color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Shrewd</span><font color="#ffffff">,
</span><font color="#ff0000">Chaotic</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Split</span><font
        color="#ffffff">, etc). Each of these choices is described in the help
files (see <a href="raceclass_contents.html"></span><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a></span><font color="#ffffff">).

There are three main screens for the birth process. The first is a
brief welcome screen in which you select the type of game to play (the
</span><font color="#ff0000">Game Mode</span><font color="#ffffff">). The next screen allows you to select or change your race,
class, gender, personality and character's name. The final screen
allows you to enter your starting stats. We will describe each of these
screens in detail, explaining things as we go. Ready?

<a name="Welcome"></a></span><font color="#c00000">The Welcome Screen
</span><font color="#ffffff">The first screen is the Welcome Screen. It simply introduces you to the
game and allows you to choose one of several options that will control
the birth process. It looks something like this:

  Welcome to </span><font color="#ff0000">FrogComposband</span><font color="#ffffff">, a dungeon exploration role-playing game.
  Your goal is to defeat the dreaded </span><font color="#ff0000">Serpent of Chaos</span><font color="#ffffff">, but before you can
  face it, you must battle many foes. Your first step is to create a
  character for this quest. The following screens will guide you through
  this process so that you may quickly begin playing. You can get general
  help at any time by pressing </span><font color="#ff8000">?</span><font color="#ffffff">.

  First, you must decide what type of game to play. </span><font color="#ff0000">Beginner Mode </span><font
        color="#ffffff">limits
  the options available, simplifying things for new players.

   </span><font color="#00ff00">Choose the Type of Game to Play
    </span><font color="#ffff00">b</span><font color="#ffffff">) Beginner
    </span><font color="#ffff00">n</span><font color="#ffffff">) Normal

    </span><font color="#ffff00">=</span><font color="#ffffff">) Options
    </span><font color="#ffff00">?</span><font color="#ffffff">) Help
    </span><font color="#ffff00">s</span><font color="#ffffff">) View Scores
  </span><font color="#ffff00">ESC</span><font color="#ffffff">) </span><font color="#ff00ff">Quit

  </span><font color="#00ff00">Tip: </span><font color="#ffffff">You can often get specific help by entering the uppercase letter
       for a command. For example, type </span><font color="#ff8000">B </span><font color="#ffffff">on this screen to receive help
       on Beginner Mode.


If you are new to the game, consider the </span><font color="#ff0000">Beginner </span><font color="#ffffff">mode. With this
option, you won't be so overwhelmed with choices as is normally the
case, allowing you to breeze through the birth process and quickly
begin playing (and enjoying) this game. Once you have played a few
times and wish to experience more of what the game has to offer,
including a vast wilderness with many diverse dungeons to explore and
the full array of race, class and personality choices, then you should
choose the </span><font color="#ff0000">Normal </span><font color="#ffffff">mode.

If you are truly bold you can experiment with the </span><font color="#ff0000">Monster </span><font color="#ffffff">option, which
allows you to play as one of many different types of monster. Monsters
don't have a class, but instead evolve into more powerful forms as they
gain experience. They also tend to have variable body types, making the
equipment sub-game both more fun and more challenging.

Also on this screen may be an option to </span><font color="#ff0000">Quick Start</span><font color="#ffffff">. This option simply
repeats the birth selections of your previous character, who presumably
just met an untimely demise. This is a useful option if you are dying
often in the early game, as it greatly speeds up the birth process.

<a name="RaceClass"></a></span><font color="#c00000">The Race/Class Screen
</span><font color="#ffffff">On this screen, you can change your race, your class and (unless you
picked Beginner Mode) your personality. The screen will look something
like the following:

So, what do we see? First, the fields in </span><font color="#00ffff">blue </span><font color="#ffffff">are those that you may
change on this screen. Default selections are already in (and sane
enough to play with), but you probably want to change them and make
your own picks. Your sex is essentially just flavor, and has almost no

at least the game is progressive enough to provide ways to swap between
those during play!). The other selections you can make are much more
important, though: your </span><font color="#ff0000">race</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">class</span><font

To the right is a table displaying information about the stat bonuses
and other modifiers you would receive from your current race, class and
personality choices. Every character has six basic attributes, called
</span><font color="#ff0000">stats</span><font color="#ffffff">, that are very important to game play; finding ways to increase
your stats will be one of your main practical goals during the game.
The six basic stats are: Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom

        color="#00ff00">[b]</a>
</span><font color="#ffffff">below for more detailed information. Your character's spell stat, if
any, is displayed in </span><font color="#ff00ff">violet</span><font color="#ffffff">; this is a very important stat for magical
classes, since it determines how well the character can cast spells,
and normally you want it to be as high as possible.

On the next screen, you will choose the starting stats for this
character, and the values you choose will be modified by the amount
shown in the table. The bottom row in the table is the total row,
showing you a nice summary of the cumulative effects of your various
birth choices. It is the value in this row that gets added to your
starting stats.

Other fields in the table include:
  </span><font color="#ff0000">Life</span><font color="#ffffff">: Life Multiplier. This value multiplies your maximum hit points
        (HP). Hit points are your character's health; if your hit
        points go below zero, you die and the game is over! See <a href="faq.html#LifeRating"></span><font
        color="#00ff00">[c]</a> </span><font color="#ffffff">for
        more on how your maximum hit points are calculated.
  </span><font color="#ff0000">BHP</span><font color="#ffffff">:  Short for Base Hit Points, this value is a lump sum added to
        your starting hit points to make the early game easier.
  </span><font color="#ff0000">Exp</span><font color="#ffffff">:  Short for Experience Factor, this percentage determines how
        quickly or slowly your character gains new levels. (All players
        begin at level 1, and may advance up to level 50. Increasing
        your level gives more hit points, improves your skills, gives
        access to more powerful spells, and may also provide other
        effects or bonuses.)

In addition to stats, your player also has skills (see <a href="birth.html#PrimarySkills"></span><font color="#00ff00">[d]</a> </span><font
        color="#ffffff">below). For
example, your Melee skill determines your ability to hit monsters in
hand to hand combat. Like stats, these skills are also affected by your
birth options, and are displayed in the information table on this and
the next screen; but, since your screen is only so wide, you'll need to
use the </span><font color="#ff8000">TAB </span><font color="#ffffff">key:

</span><font color="#ffffff">Ah, we see that hobbits aren't so good at melee. However, the class
choice of Rogue more than makes up for this, and we can tell from the
summary line that this character's melee skill will be pretty good. It
is a general rule that class influences skills more than race and
personality do, especially later in the game (as you gain levels, you
also gain skill bonuses, but mostly through your class). The main
exception to this rule is Stealth, where the bonuses tend to be zero.

Below the player fields and the information table is a list of commands
that you may choose. These commands might bring up a menu of choices
for you to select from, as, for example, the Change Race command:

Changing the </span><font color="#ff0000">game speed </span><font color="#ffffff">does not affect your character directly;
rather, it selects the type of game you wish to play. The options are
</span><font color="#ff0000">normal </span><font color="#ffffff">(a full game with a wilderness), </span><font
        color="#ff0000">coffee-break </span><font color="#ffffff">(an accelerated
game with no wilderness) and </span><font color="#ff0000">instant-coffee </span><font color="#ffffff">(an ultra-accelerated
game). Game speed selection is not available in Beginner Mode, where
the coffee-break setting is always used.

When you are happy with your character choices, press </span><font color="#ff8000">RET </span><font color="#ffffff">to move on to
the next screen. You can always </span><font color="#ff8000">ESC </span><font color="#ffffff">to back up and make changes, so
experiment as much as you want.

<a name="Stats"></a></span><font color="#c00000">The Stats Screen
</span><font color="#ffffff">On this screen, you enter your starting stats. You do this by
allocating points to each stat; you have a total of 30 points to spend,
though you can get some more by allocating negative points to stats you
really don't care about at all. Very high starting stats are expensive.
By default, the game tries to guess a reasonable allocation, and if you
are a new player, you might just want to use the defaults.

Guide; they explain more about what you'll be up against, and contain
tips to help get you started. There is much more in the in-game help
besides, but you probably don't really want to bury yourself in 500
pages of documentation!

<a name="CharAttributes"></a></span><font color="#c00000">Character Attributes
</span><font color="#ffffff">During the game (and even during the birth process), you will see many
different numerical values that are used to measure or determine your
character's relative skills and abilities. Here's a quick overview:

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Statistics
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Each character has six basic statistics (or more simply </span><font color="#ff0000">stats</span><font
        color="#ffffff">). These
  are strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and
  charisma, and they modify the abilities of the character in a variety
  of ways. For example, strength affects your carrying capacity, the
  amount of damage you do to a monster when you hit it, and the number
  of blows per round you get with a weapon. See <a href="birth.html#PrimaryStats"></span><font
        color="#00ff00">[g]</a> </span><font color="#ffffff">below for more
  detail on the basic statistics.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Experience (EXP/XP)
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Experience affects almost everything else about your character.
  Experience is mostly gained by slaying monsters, but can also be
  earned by casting spells for the first time, disarming traps or
  unlocking doors. Certain classes may also gain experience by
  destroying specific dungeon spellbooks, and there are potions in the
  dungeon that will boost your experience if you quaff them. The
  Android race follows its own unique experience rules.

  When your character's experience crosses certain fixed boundaries,
  you will attain a new </span><font color="#ff0000">character level </span><font color="#ffffff">(up to a maximum of 50). When
  this happens, your hit point pool, mana pool (if any) and primary
  skills will all increase; you might also gain new powers or
  abilities, or get to improve a stat of your choice. The character
  level boundaries depend on the Experience Factor noted above.

  Certain monsters can "drain" your experience, and thus potentially
  also lower your character level. Luckily, you can restore drained
  experience through magical means, through town services, or simply by
  regaining the experience all over again.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Gold (AU)
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Each character starts with some gold, which can be used to buy items
  and services from the shops and other buildings in towns. More gold
  can be obtained by selling items to the shops, taking it from the
  corpses of dead monsters, mining it, or simply by finding it lying on
  the dungeon floor.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Hit Points (HP)
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Each character has hit points, representing how much damage the
  character can sustain before he dies. Your HP pool depends on your
  character level, race, class, personality, constitution, equipment
  and life rating, and can be temporarily boosted with magic; see <a href="faq.html#LifeRating"></span><font
        color="#00ff00">[h]</a>
  </span><font color="#ffffff">for a detailed explanation. Lost hit points may be regained by
  resting, or by a variety of magical means.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Spell Points (SP/Mana)
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Many characters have spell points, or mana, which represents how many
  spells they can cast. Your mana pool depends on your character level,
  class, the primary spellcasting stat of your class, and any penalties
  from sources like excessively heavy armor (see <a href="magic.html#CastingSpells"></span><font
        color="#00ff00">[i]</a></span><font color="#ffffff">). Lost spell
  points may be regained by resting or by magical means.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Skills
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Each character has several primary skills: disarming, magic device
  skill, saving throw, stealth, searching, perception, melee, and
  archery (bows/throws). These skills are derived from the character's
  race, class, personality, stats, level and magical equipment. The
  skills are described in more detail below (see <a href="birth.html#PrimarySkills"></span><font
        color="#00ff00">[j]</a></span><font color="#ffffff">).

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Speed
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Speed is an incredibly important attribute. The speed system is
  somewhat complicated; but basically, the more speed somebody has
  (whether it's you or a monster), the more often they get a turn
  compared to everybody else. If you are really slow, an enemy might
  get four or five or six moves for every one move you get, which
  obviously isn't ideal - but won't it be fun when you get more speed
  and can turn the tables?

  Losing speed is very easy: just carry more items than your strength
  comfortably allows. But to increase your speed you generally need
  magic, either in the form of a spell or potion, or in the form of an
  enchanted piece of equipment (such as </span><font color="#ff0000">Boots of Speed</span><font color="#ffffff">). Potions of
  Speed will serve the early player well, and you should use them
  liberally against foes that seem too powerful otherwise (especially
  quest monsters and level guardians!). As you dive deeper, you will
  quickly find normal unenchanted speed insufficient; even with bags of
  HP, you could still die from full health without getting a single
  action if your opponent is too fast compared to you.

<a name="PrimaryStats"></a></span><font color="#c00000">Statistics
</span><font color="#ffffff">Each character has six basic stats (strength, intelligence, wisdom,
dexterity, constitution, and charisma) which modify the abilities of
the character in a variety of ways. Every stat has a numerical value,
ranging from a minimum of 3 to a tipping point at 18, and beyond that
into a fractional range represented as </span><font color="#ff0000">18/01 </span><font
        color="#ffffff">through </span><font color="#ff0000">18/220</span><font color="#ffffff">; 18/220 is
the maximal value, and generally displayed as </span><font color="#ff0000">18/***</span><font color="#ffffff">. In this notation,
18/10 is equivalent to what a new player might intuitively think of as
19, 18/20 is equivalent to 20 etc.; but the switch in notations makes
it clear that there is a tipping point at 18, beyond which sources of
permanent stat gain work in a very different way.

As you play the game, your stats can be increased through magical
means, as a reward for accomplishing a difficult task, or as a reward
for gaining enough experience to advance to a key level. Eventually,
your stats will reach their internal maximum value (or </span><font color="#ff0000">stat cap</span><font
        color="#ffffff">), which
is a value between 18/70 and 18/130 and is randomly chosen at character
birth. At this point, it will be up to your race, class and personality
modifiers, magical equipment, and maybe other sources like a bizarre
mutation, to boost your stats further up to the 18/*** limit.

Your </span><font color="#ff0000">primary stat </span><font color="#ffffff">(or </span><font color="#ff0000">spellcasting stat</span><font
        color="#ffffff">) determines your spell fail
rates and the size of your mana pool, as well as how many spells you
can learn if you are a book spellcaster. As a general rule, if your
spellcasting stat falls to 7 or below, you run out of mana altogether.

Which stats are important varies from character to character, although
practically everyone wants decent Strength and Intelligence, and
Constitution becomes ever more valuable as the game progresses. Melee
characters need Dexterity, and magic users require above all whichever
stat is their spellcasting stat. Allocate your points accordingly!

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Strength (STR)
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Strength is critical to fighting effectively in melee combat and with
  missile weapons. A high strength will improve the number of blows you
  get with your melee weapon, increases the amount of damage done with
  each hit, allows you to use heavier weapons without penalties and
  slightly improves your accuracy. Strength is also useful for
  tunnelling, bashing doors and simply for carrying heavy items without
  being slowed down. Many melee classes, such as Maulers, Berserkers
  and Weaponmasters, use Strength as their primary stat.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Intelligence (INT)
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Intelligent characters are better at using magic devices, picking
  locks and disarming traps. Intelligence also influences how quickly
  characters learn from their experiences. Intelligence is a common
  primary spellcasting stat for mage-like spellcasters.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Wisdom (WIS)
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Wise characters have higher saving throws, giving them a better
  chance to resist evil curses and paralysis. Wisdom also affects the
  speed at which level feelings and object feelings appear. Wisdom is a
  common spellcasting stat for priest-like classes.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Dexterity (DEX)
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness. High dexterity
  allows you to get more blows with weapons, thus greatly improving
  your melee damage; it also improves your accuracy with any weapon,
  and directly affects your AC by allowing you to dodge blows from
  enemies. Dexterity is also useful in picking locks, disarming traps,
  and protecting yourself from the thieves that inhabit the dungeons.
  Dexterity is the spellcasting stat for a number of classes, including
  the "default"-selection Burglary Rogue.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Constitution (CON)
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his body.
  Characters with a high Constitution receive more hit points and
  recover from wounds and stunning more rapidly. Blood-Knights use
  constitution as their primary stat.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Charisma (CHR)
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Charisma represents a character's personality and force of will.
  Characters with a high Charisma receive more favorable pricing at
  shops, and all charming effects work better with high charisma.
  Additionally, charisma is used for determining player and monster
  fear; players with low charisma are often frightened, sometimes even
  to the point of paralysis (see <a href="status.html#Fear"></span><font color="#00ff00">[k]</a></span><font
        color="#ffffff">)! Conversely, charismatic players
  can more easily break the morale of their foes. A number of classes,
  such as Bards and Sorcerers, use Charisma as their primary spell
  stat.

<a name="PrimarySkills"></a></span><font color="#c00000">Skills
</span><font color="#ffffff">These attributes are generally based largely on your class, but can
also be affected by your race, personality, stats and equipment. They
often, but not always, go up with character level:

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Melee
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Melee skill is very simply a baseline for your accuracy in melee
  combat (whether armed or unarmed). Strength and Dexterity boost this
  skill, and you can further boost your accuracy through combat bonuses
  on equipment. This skill increases with character level, except for
  Sorcerers who are uniformly poor at melee.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Archery
  </span><font color="#ffffff">This skill generally applies both to using ranged missile weapons and
  to throwing projectiles, although in some cases separate calculations
  might apply. Archery skill, like melee skill, is a baseline for your
  accuracy; but exceptionally high Archery skill can also improve your
  shooting speed and reduce the chance your ammunition breaks on
  impact. Strength and Dexterity can boost your Archery, although this
  boost only affects your accuracy and not the additional bonuses
  noted. Archery improves naturally with character level for all
  characters except Berserkers and Sorcerers.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Saving Throw
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Saving Throw is the ability of your character to resist the effects
  of spells cast on you by a monster. Most commonly, Saving Throw is
  applied when the spell involves some kind of curse, either against
  you or against your equipment. Saving Throw also helps you against
  paralysis, though having Free Action is also needed for that! This
  skill increases naturally with level - but you'll also be running
  into nastier curses at high levels... Saving Throw is affected by
  Wisdom.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Stealth
  </span><font color="#ffffff">The ability to move silently is very useful. Characters with good
  stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining the first blow
  (or the opportunity to avoid a fight entirely), while characters with
  low Stealth will be mobbed by enemies as everybody nearby wakes up.
  Stealth generally does not improve with character level, and depends
  only on your race, class, personality and equipment. New players
  should value Stealth highly; the less experience you have handling
  monster mobs, the less you can afford to invite them.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Disarming
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Disarming is the ability to remove traps (safely), and includes
  picking locks on chests and doors. A successful disarming will gain
  the character some experience. A trap must be found before it can be
  disarmed. Dexterity and Intelligence both affect Disarming skill, and
  this skill also increases with character level.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Magic Device Skill
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Using magical devices requires experience and knowledge, and natural
  spellcasters such as mages tend to be much better at it than melee
  classes. Device Skill is the most important of all skills, especially
  in the late game; and although your class accounts for the bulk of
  your device skill, the bonuses from race and personality are also
  important simply because the skill itself is so important. Device
  Skill is affected by Intelligence, and improves with character level.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Perception (Searching Frequency)
  Searching (Searching Ability)
  </span><font color="#ffffff">These two skills are very closely related. Both help you notice
  secret doors, floor traps, and traps on chests; Searching helps when
  you are actively looking for them, and Perception might allow you to
  notice them without actively looking. Searching also improves your
  ability to see invisible monsters. These skills are based on your
  race, class, personality and equipment, and generally do not improve
  with character level.

<a name="Abilities"></a></span><font color="#c00000">Additional Abilities

</span><font color="#ffffff">Like stats and skills, these additional abilities help your character
survive and get about. They can be affected by your race, class or
personality, but only in exceptional cases (apart from Infravision,
which is based mostly on your race). As such, these abilities are not
as prominently displayed during the birth process, but they do make a
difference during the game!<font color="#00ff00">Note: Although pressing </span><font color="#ff8000">? </span><font color="#00ff00">on the introduction screen
    will take you here, and this page does give a quick
    overview of much in the game, it is not the main page

<a name="CreateAt"></a></span><font color="#00ffff">Creating a Character

</span><font color="#ffffff">FrogComposband is a role-playing game in which you - the player -
control a character in a dangerous world of myth and magic, populated
with demons, dragons, deities, ducks and other rare and strange
creatures of the Last Days. The most important decision you make on
your quest to slay the </span><font color="#ff0000">Serpent of Chaos </span><font color="#ffffff">is what kind of character to
play: spell-wielding magician or sword-waving warrior? Stealthy rogue
or musical bard? Holy priest or evil spawn of chaos? The choices are
myriad, and the process of generating a new character is described in
this help file, which will also serve to introduce you to many of the
core concepts of the game.

Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of
choices. You must choose your character's race (</span><font color="#ff0000">Human</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font
            color="#ff0000">Dwarf</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Hobbit</span><font
            color="#ffffff">,
</span><font color="#ff0000">Ogre</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Vampire</span><font
            color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Werewolf</span><font color="#ffffff">, etc), your character's class (</span><font
            color="#ff0000">Warrior</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Mage</span><font
            color="#ffffff">,
</span><font color="#ff0000">Priest</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Lawyer</span><font
            color="#ffffff">, etc) and your character's personality (</span><font color="#ff0000">Mighty</span><font
            color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Shrewd</span><font color="#ffffff">,
</span><font color="#ff0000">Chaotic</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">Split</span><font
            color="#ffffff">, etc). Each of these choices is described in the help
files (see <a href="raceclass_contents.html"></span><font color="#00ff00">[a]</a></span><font color="#ffffff">).

There are three main screens for the birth process. The first is a
brief welcome screen in which you select the type of game to play (the
</span><font color="#ff0000">Game Mode</span><font color="#ffffff">). The next screen allows you to select or change your race,
class, gender, personality and character's name. The final screen
allows you to enter your starting stats. We will describe each of these
screens in detail, explaining things as we go. Ready?

<a name="Welcome"></a></span><font color="#c00000">The Welcome Screen
</span><font color="#ffffff">The first screen is the Welcome Screen. It simply introduces you to the
game and allows you to choose one of several options that will control
the birth process. It looks something like this:

  Welcome to </span><font color="#ff0000">FrogComposband</span><font color="#ffffff">, a dungeon exploration role-playing game.
  Your goal is to defeat the dreaded </span><font color="#ff0000">Serpent of Chaos</span><font color="#ffffff">, but before you can
  face it, you must battle many foes. Your first step is to create a
  character for this quest. The following screens will guide you through
  this process so that you may quickly begin playing. You can get general
  help at any time by pressing </span><font color="#ff8000">?</span><font color="#ffffff">.

  First, you must decide what type of game to play. </span><font color="#ff0000">Beginner Mode </span><font
            color="#ffffff">limits
  the options available, simplifying things for new players.

   </span><font color="#00ff00">Choose the Type of Game to Play
    </span><font color="#ffff00">b</span><font color="#ffffff">) Beginner
    </span><font color="#ffff00">n</span><font color="#ffffff">) Normal

  </span><font color="#ffff00">ESC</span><font color="#ffffff">) </span><font color="#ff00ff">Quit

  </span><font color="#00ff00">Tip: </span><font color="#ffffff">You can often get specific help by entering the uppercase letter
       for a command. For example, type </span><font color="#ff8000">B </span><font color="#ffffff">on this screen to receive help
       on Beginner Mode.


If you are new to the game, consider the </span><font color="#ff0000">Beginner </span><font color="#ffffff">mode. With this
option, you won't be so overwhelmed with choices as is normally the
case, allowing you to breeze through the birth process and quickly
begin playing (and enjoying) this game. Once you have played a few
times and wish to experience more of what the game has to offer,
including a vast wilderness with many diverse dungeons to explore and
the full array of race, class and personality choices, then you should
choose the </span><font color="#ff0000">Normal </span><font color="#ffffff">mode.

If you are truly bold you can experiment with the </span><font color="#ff0000">Monster </span><font color="#ffffff">option, which
allows you to play as one of many different types of monster. Monsters
don't have a class, but instead evolve into more powerful forms as they
gain experience. They also tend to have variable body types, making the
equipment sub-game both more fun and more challenging.

Also on this screen may be an option to </span><font color="#ff0000">Quick Start</span><font color="#ffffff">. This option simply
repeats the birth selections of your previous character, who presumably
just met an untimely demise. This is a useful option if you are dying
often in the early game, as it greatly speeds up the birth process.

<a name="RaceClass"></a></span><font color="#c00000">The Race/Class Screen
</span><font color="#ffffff">On this screen, you can change your race, your class and (unless you
picked Beginner Mode) your personality. The screen will look something
like the following:

       for a command. For example, type </span><font color="#ff8000">R </span><font color="#ffffff">on this screen to receive help
       on your currently selected race.

So, what do we see? First, the fields in </span><font color="#00ffff">blue </span><font color="#ffffff">are those that you may
change on this screen. Default selections are already in (and sane
enough to play with), but you probably want to change them and make
your own picks. Your sex is essentially just flavor, and has almost no
game-play effects (choices are limited to simply Male and Female, but
at least the game is progressive enough to provide ways to swap between
those during play!). The other selections you can make are much more
important, though: your </span><font color="#ff0000">race</span><font color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">class</span><font
            color="#ffffff">, </span><font color="#ff0000">personality</span><font color="#ffffff">, and </span><font
            color="#ff0000">magic realms </span><font color="#ffffff">(if
any) will form the key to your character.

To the right is a table displaying information about the stat bonuses
and other modifiers you would receive from your current race, class and
personality choices. Every character has six basic attributes, called
</span><font color="#ff0000">stats</span><font color="#ffffff">, that are very important to game play; finding ways to increase
your stats will be one of your main practical goals during the game.
The six basic stats are: Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom
(WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON) and Charisma (CHR); see <a href="birth.html#PrimaryStats"></span><font
            color="#00ff00">[b]</a>
</span><font color="#ffffff">below for more detailed information. Your character's spell stat, if
any, is displayed in </span><font color="#ff00ff">violet</span><font color="#ffffff">; this is a very important stat for magical
classes, since it determines how well the character can cast spells,
and normally you want it to be as high as possible.

On the next screen, you will choose the starting stats for this
character, and the values you choose will be modified by the amount
shown in the table. The bottom row in the table is the total row,
showing you a nice summary of the cumulative effects of your various
birth choices. It is the value in this row that gets added to your
starting stats.

Other fields in the table include:
  </span><font color="#ff0000">Life</span><font color="#ffffff">: Life Multiplier. This value multiplies your maximum hit points
        (HP). Hit points are your character's health; if your hit
        points go below zero, you die and the game is over! See <a href="faq.html#LifeRating"></span><font
            color="#00ff00">[c]</a> </span><font color="#ffffff">for
        more on how your maximum hit points are calculated.
  </span><font color="#ff0000">BHP</span><font color="#ffffff">:  Short for Base Hit Points, this value is a lump sum added to
        your starting hit points to make the early game easier.
  </span><font color="#ff0000">Exp</span><font color="#ffffff">:  Short for Experience Factor, this percentage determines how
        quickly or slowly your character gains new levels. (All players
        begin at level 1, and may advance up to level 50. Increasing
        your level gives more hit points, improves your skills, gives
        access to more powerful spells, and may also provide other
        effects or bonuses.)

In addition to stats, your player also has skills (see <a href="birth.html#PrimarySkills"></span><font color="#00ff00">[d]</a> </span><font
            color="#ffffff">below). For
example, your Melee skill determines your ability to hit monsters in
hand to hand combat. Like stats, these skills are also affected by your
birth options, and are displayed in the information table on this and
the next screen; but, since your screen is only so wide, you'll need to
use the </span><font color="#ff8000">TAB </span><font color="#ffffff">key:

</span><font color="#ffffff">And </span><font color="#ff8000">TAB </span><font color="#ffffff">again:

</span><font color="#ffffff">Ah, we see that hobbits aren't so good at melee. However, the class
choice of Rogue more than makes up for this, and we can tell from the
summary line that this character's melee skill will be pretty good. It
is a general rule that class influences skills more than race and
personality do, especially later in the game (as you gain levels, you
also gain skill bonuses, but mostly through your class). The main
exception to this rule is Stealth, where the bonuses tend to be zero.

Below the player fields and the information table is a list of commands
that you may choose. These commands might bring up a menu of choices
for you to select from, as, for example, the Change Race command:

<a name="CreateAt"></a></span><font color="#00ffff">Creating a Character


  </span><font color="#00ffff">Regeneration
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Regeneration determines how quickly you recover lost hit points and
  mana. It is generally affected only by magical effects or equipment,
  not by your race or class, though there are some exceptions (for
  example, Amberites, Beornings, Werewolves and Einherjar regenerate
  exceptionally fast). If you get hit with an evil curse that affects
  your regeneration, or suffer hideous mutations that slow it down, the
  pain will hit very quickly...

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Infravision
  </span><font color="#ffffff">Infravision is the ability to see heat sources. Since dungeons tend
  to be cool or cold, infravision will not allow your character to see
  walls or objects, but does allow you to detect warm-blooded creatures
  up to a certain distance. Infravision works equally well with or
  without a light source. Many monsters are cold-blooded and so not
  detected by infravision, but especially in the early game (when
  warm-blooded monsters are more common and See Invisible is often
  lacking) infravision can make a difference. Most non-human races have
  some innate infravision, and any race can gain infravision from
  magical equipment.

  </span><font color="#00ffff">Digging
  </span><font color="#ffffff">This ability allows you to mine for treasures and create new tunnels
  more effectively. It is affected by Strength, by magical equipment,
  by digging implements such as picks and shovels, and by the weight of
  your weapon/digging implement (heavy weapons are better for digging).
  Digging is not usually affected by race, class or personality,
  although again there are some exceptions; Lawyers, for instance, are
  very good at digging.

<a name="BirthOptions"></a></span><font color="#c00000">Birth Options
</span><font color="#ffffff">During character generation you may press '=' at any time to access the
birth options, unless you selected </span><font color="#ff0000">Beginner Mode </span><font color="#ffffff">which assigns
mostly-default options to you. Popular birth options include
</span><font color="#ff0000">coffee-break mode</span><font color="#ffffff">, which accelerates the game (but removes the
wilderness); </span><font color="#ff0000">no selling</span><font color="#ffffff">, which increases gold drops in the dungeon but
prevents the player from selling items for money; and </span><font color="#ff0000">no scrambling</span><font
            color="#ffffff">,
which removes the controversial Stat Scrambling mechanic from the game
and replaces it with an incantation of the evil but less controversial
Baby Foul Curse. There are dozens of other birth options as well, some
likewise popular, others very niche; see <a href="option.html#Birth"></span><font color="#00ff00">[l]</a> </span><font
            color="#ffffff">for a detailed explanation
of each.

<a name="Reference"></a></span><font color="#c00000">Reference

<a name="BeginnerMode"></a></span><font color="#ff0000">Beginner Mode  </span><font color="#ffffff">Designed for new players, this mode greatly restricts
               the races and classes available to you. In addition, it
               removes </span><font color="#ff0000">Personality </span><font color="#ffffff">from the birth process,
               automatically assigning you the Ordinary personality
               (which has absolutely no gameplay effects). Birth option
               selection (</span><font color="#ff8000">=</span><font color="#ffffff">) is also disabled to speed up character
               creation; you will play with automatically assigned,
               mostly default options. The </span><font color="#ff0000">effective_speed </span><font color="#ffffff">display
               option ("Show speeds as energy multipliers") is turned
               on by default in Beginner Mode, as it makes the meanings
               of speed values clearer to new players. Finally, this
               option forces the player to play in </span><font color="#ff0000">coffee-break mode</span><font
            color="#ffffff">,
               which accelerates the game, eliminates the wilderness
               and uses the special Lite-Town as the only town. Since
               up staircases don't generate in coffee-break mode,
               beginners start with extra scrolls of Word of Recall so
               they (hopefully) won't get stuck in the dungeon.

<a name="NormalMode"></a></span><font color="#ff0000">Normal Mode    </span><font color="#ffffff">This is the standard way to play: the Full Monty, so to
               speak. All races and classes are available to choose
               from, even ones that might be under development and not
               yet fully tested. The player has access to both the
               Birth Options and the Personality subsystem. Here you
               may (if you wish!) play with a vast surface wilderness,
               complete with numerous dungeons and towns to explore.

<a name="MonsterMode"></a></span><font color="#ff0000">Monster Mode   </span><font color="#ffffff">This mode allows the player to play as a monster rather
               than a normal character. There is no class to choose;
               instead, the racial (and subracial) choices determine
               the type of monster you play, and are effectively both
               your race and your class. There are many options to
               choose from, including some really zany ones! Most
               monster forms evolve from weak forms to stronger ones
               (e.g. from a Forest Troll to a Fire Troll, and so
               forth); and many forms have unique body types (e.g. a
               Xorn has two full sets of arms, and can wield up to four
               melee weapons). In addition, most monster races have a
               boss who will drop a nifty artifact when slain. But the
               goal of the game remains the same: kill the </span><font color="#ff0000">Serpent of
               Chaos</span><font color="#ffffff">.

<a name="QuickStart"></a></span><font color="#ff0000">Quick Start    </span><font color="#ffffff">Once an existing character dies, you may create a new
               one from the same savefile. If so, you receive this
               extra option; choose quick start, and you get a new
               character with exactly the same race, class, options,
               and personality as your last character. Since it is
               common to die early on, Quick Start can save you the
               tedium of picking the same choices again and again.

<a name="CharacterName"></a></span><font color="#ff0000">Character Name </span><font color="#ffffff">During the birth process, you may change the name of
               your character. This name will be used for your savefile
               (unless you created this character inside an existing,
               already named savefile) and any options and preferences
               you may set. So choose your name carefully. Changing
               your name, as you may imagine, is a complicated legal
               process involving much paperwork (and a hefty fee).
               Should you decide to change your name in the future,
               inquire at Count Uldrik's castle and he will direct you
               how to proceed.
