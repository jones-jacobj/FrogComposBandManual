                <li>In 1980 a video game was released for personal home computers; Rogue (Rogue: Exploring the Dungeons of Doom)</li>
                <li>This video game was revolutionary as it used procedural generation to provide the player with a near limitless amount of content. Levels would never be the same, the items you come in contact with had randomized stats, and the video game had an unforgiving difficulty</li>
                <li>In Rogue dying was as much part of the game as playing it in the first place. You (the user) learn, while your adventurers die.</li>
                <li>Today we use the term Roguelike to describe games that are - like Rogue. The more like Rogue a game is, the more of a roguelike it is considered. Other elements of procedural generation exist, and some games offer meta progression. These games are generally considered Rogue-lite games.</li>

                <li>In 1990 a Roguelike was released for personal home computers named Angband- it was a roguelike set in the fantasy world of Middle Earth, a product of the writer J.R.R. Tolkien</li>
                <li>In this game players could come in contact with famous Middle Earth characters, such as Gollum. It had a starter town, and a nearly limitless dungeon. The player was encouraged to level, progress, and make it to the bottom of the dungeon of Angband and defeat Morgoth.</li>
                <li>While Angband was popular in its own right; it represented another revolution in Roguelikes- games that are variants of Angbands are generally called 'bands'. Multiple variants popped up, ZAngband, MAngband, and many more!</li>
                <li>These variants would, themselves, become the basis of other variants - from ZAngband came Cthangband, PernAngband, and Hengband.</li>
